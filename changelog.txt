Added:
- Hearts now have spawn eggs
- There is now a config option to disable structures from spawning; you can chose to disable each structure individually or every single one (note, this will disable the Shadow ore as well)

Removed:
- Had to remove the better Alpaca modelling system until Fisk decides to create a page where I can find all the downloads (post it on curse already :p)

Changed:
- Improved molten liquids
- Improved the Cursed Eye following the player algorithm 
- Improved Hearts mechanics, now they should be a bit more reliable
- Hearts now render on the right side of the hotbar rather than the left
- Improved color detection system (should be less laggy now)

Fixed:
- Structures crashing servers
